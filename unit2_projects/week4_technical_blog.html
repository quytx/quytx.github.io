		<li><u>Using a <font color="magenta">while/until</font> loop:</u> a conditional block of code that keeps executing while the conditional statement is true. 
			<p class = "quote">while (conditional statement) <br/>
				<span class = "tab"> 
				# do something here - while the conditional statement is TRUE
				</span>	<br/>
				end
			</p>
			or similarly using "until" instead of "while"
			<p class = "quote">until (conditional statement) <br/>
				<span class = "tab"> 
				# do something here - while the conditional statement is FALSE

				</span>	<br/>
				end
			</p>
			The while/until loop is useful when you do not know exactly how many times the loop will be executed. Be careful when selecting the conditional statement - you might end up with an infinite loop !!

		</li>

		<br/>
		<li>Using a for loop: </li>
			<p class = "quote">for [variable] in [range] do <br/>
				<span class = "tab"> 
				# do something here - will be executed for each value of the local variable
				</span>	<br/>
				end
			</p>
			Syntax for [range] may include the beginning and ending values of the variable. For example:
			<p class = "quote">for x in 0..3 do  <br/>
				<span class = "tab"> 
				 puts x # this will print out each value of x in the range
				</span>	<br/>
				end
			</p>

			The for loop should be used when you know exactly the range (or how many times) the loop needs to be executed. Be careful when selecting the range - your program might crash during the loop if something "out of range" is called !!
