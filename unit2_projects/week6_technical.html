		Functional Programming makes code understandable by minimizing moving parts.</p>
		<br/>
		In <font color="orange">functional progamming</font>, a task is broken down into smaller tasks, which are then implemented step by step, in order.
		<br/>
		For example, a simple task is to calculate the area of a circle with given radius. To do this by functional programming, we simply create a function which takes a number (radius) as the input, and the result would be PI * radius * radius. Simple enough.
		<br/>
		<br/>

		In <font color="magenta">object-oriented programming</font>, a task is done by creating objects with their own behaviors and then the task will be completed as a result of interactions between objects. 
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Back to the example above, if we want to do the task in an object-oriented programming way, we would need to think of everything as objects. What would be the object here? Quite intuitively, we can say that the object is a circle with a given radius. But what about its area? Well, we can think of the area as a behavior of the object, that is when the behavior happens, it gives us the area - what we need.
		<br/>
		<br/>

		In reality, everything is an object, whether or not it is visible.
