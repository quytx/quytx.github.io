		</font></center></h2>

		In general, a SQL injection is one way for hackers to steal data from a website.
        <br/>
        For example, mostly every website that have users data such as name, date of birth, etc. allow users to hide their private info by providing them a unique account that is only accessible if a correct combination of username and password are entered. But if the website does not have any sort of injection-protected function, hackers can break in the database and steal data without knowing the username and/or password.
		<br/>
        <br/>
        
		Ok, now let's look at this specific example. Let's say you visit an online shopping website where you created an account with username and password, i.e
        <p class ="quote">username: John Snow
        <br/>
        password: Iamhandsome
        </p>
        Whenever you enter your username and password, the website will make a query to the database to validate the info. If poorly constructed, the query may look like this:
        <p class ="quote">SELECT *
        <br/>
        FROM customers_database
        <br/>
        WHERE username = 'INPUT_NAME'
        <br/>
        AND password = 'INPUT_PASSWORD'
        </p>
        If you think you're safe, think again. What if the hacker who already knows your username enters something like:
        <p class ="quote">username: 'John Snow'
        <br/>
        password: '123456' OR 1 = 1
        </p>
        What happens next, is this query will be called:
        <p class ="quote">SELECT *
        <br/>
        FROM customers_database
        <br/>
        WHERE username = 'John Snow'
        <br/>
        AND password = ('123456' OR 1 = 1)
        </p>
        Now, since 1 = 1 is always true, the condition is always true even though 123456 is not the correct password (it should be "Iamhandsome" instead). And boom, your info is now completely exposed!!!
		<br/>
		<br/>
        
		To prevent this from happening, obviously you have to change the way the website takes input. One way is to validate the input <font color="magenta">BEFORE</font> making the query, to make sure that it contains no suspicious elements.
		<br/>
        Of course there are more complex ways as well, but I hope you get the idea.
