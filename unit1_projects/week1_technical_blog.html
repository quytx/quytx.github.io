		<h2><font color="#00FFFF"><u>LiveScore:

		<font color="#A9F5F2"; size="4">
		<ul>
		<li>As the title says, live scores are updated directly from the source, in real-time.</li>
		<li>My eyes are drawn directly to the scores of the most recent matches/games. The website is very simple, on a dark theme, which does not hurt my eyes at all. Yet I can always find what I am looking for easily.</li>
		<li>There are many other livescore websites, however I still prefer livescore.com simply because it is simple, and has information I need. Other websites may be fancy, colorful, but why would I care about anything rather than the score itself?</li>
		<li>Another good thing is the site has no ads whatsoever, that makes reading even easier.</li>		
		</ul>

		<h2><font color="red"><u>YouTube:</u></font></h2>
		<font color="#F5A9A9"; size="4">
		<ul>
		<li>I don't know how much time I have spent on Youtube. When I don't know what to do in front of my computer, my default address is this!</li>
		<li>Visually the website is also pretty simple. White background, black text, with a screenshot for each video.</li>
		<li>Seaching for a certain video clip is easy. But most of the time I don't really know what to watch, so here comes the suggestions. They are all based on what I recently watched the most, and I just keep clicking on one after another. I don't even need the keyboard! I feel like I could stay on this website forever.</li>
