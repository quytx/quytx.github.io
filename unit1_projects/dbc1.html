			<h1><font size="4">1. Education: </font></h1>
				<font size="3">I finished my first bachelor degree in Finance and Accounting in 2011. I worked for Ernst and Young as a Senior Auditor after graduation and later on I realized that business is not where my true passion lies. I decided to go back to school for Computer Science and now I am currently studying at the University of Wisconsin - Madison as a full-time student.</font>	

			<h2><font size="4">2. Programming background: </font></h2>
				<font size="3">I started learning programming in early 2014. Some languages that I have partially learned:
				<ol>
	  				<li>Java <i>(probably the one I feel most comfortable with)</i></li>
						<li>LC-3 Assembly <i>(a very low-level language)</i></li>
				  	<li>Arduino <i>(just a little bit)</i></li>
				</ol>			
				</font>
